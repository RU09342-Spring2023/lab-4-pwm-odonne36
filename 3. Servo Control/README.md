# Servo Control

This code works by varying the pwm signal length of the output for the servo. I started by initalizing the buttons as inputs as well as setting up a timer in up mode. Next, after looking at the datasheet for a servo, I observed that it wants a pwm signal that is between 1 and 2 ms period. When the pwm is at one end it rotates the servo ccw and at the other cw. I then have a while loop that checks if any of the buttons are being pressed, if they are then i either add or subtract from my CCR1 register to vary the direction and speed the servo will move. I also have logic that determines if the CCR1 register is above or below a certain threshold, and break from the loop as to not damage the servo. In the future, interrupts could be implemented for more efficient code and quicker response times.
